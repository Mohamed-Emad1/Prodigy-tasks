              <p style="width: 350px;">
                Greetings! I am a dedicated and passionate student currently
                pursuing my education at the Faculty of Engineering at
                Alexandria University, specializing in Computer and
                Communication. My academic journey began at Alwarit Ben Kaab
                school in the Sultanate of Oman during high school. Along the
                way, I've actively participated in the prestigious ECPC 2022,
                showcasing my enthusiasm for computer programming and
                problem-solving.
                <br />
                Driven by a fervor for technology, I have embarked on various
                projects that reflect my skills and creativity. I developed a
                library system and a captivating clown game using Java,
                showcasing my proficiency in the language. Additionally, I
                crafted a thrilling snake game with Python, demonstrating
                versatility in programming languages.
                <br />

                My exploration of mobile app development led me to create a News
                app and a Quiz app using Flutter. These projects not only honed
                my skills in mobile application development but also underscored
                my commitment to staying at the forefront of technological
                advancements.
                <br />
                As I continue my academic and professional journey, I am eager
                to contribute my skills and knowledge to innovative projects
                that push the boundaries of what is possible in the realm of
                computer science and engineering.

            <h2>front end and back end Developer</h2>
            <p style="width: 340px">
              Front-end developers focus on creating the user interface and user
              experience of a website or application. They work with HTML, CSS,
              and JavaScript to design and implement the visual elements that
              users interact with. Additionally, proficiency in Vue.js, a
              JavaScript framework, allows them to build dynamic and responsive
              front-end components. On the other hand, back-end developers are
              responsible for the server-side logic and database interactions
              that power the application. They use PHP for server-side scripting
              and SQL for database management, ensuring data is stored,
              retrieved, and manipulated efficiently. Together, front-end and
              back-end developers collaborate to deliver a seamless and
              functional digital experience, leveraging their combined expertise
              in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, PHP, and SQL.
